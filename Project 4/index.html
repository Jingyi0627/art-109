                    The Internet in the next fifty years is hard to predict, but given the current update speed of the
                    Internet, it will
                    surely still be around people and fill every corner. Perhaps the Internet is no longer composed of a
                    cold screen, but
                    appears in People's Daily lives in different forms and states. </p>People may not need to start it
                manually but can awaken
                it through some medium and record the changes of individuals, groups or even society at any time.
                The future of the
                online world can be freely imagined without limit, but along with it comes the fact that emotional
                connections between
                people can easily become more fragile because of the Internet. Data is always cold and rational,
                making it difficult to
                fully handle complex emotions and unable to effectively read these untouchable inner worlds in a
                timely manner. This
                article will explore the possible forms of the network that may emerge in the future and how
                people's emotions can
                survive healthily in the virtual online environment.
                </p>


                </p>

                <h3>Data technology</h3>
                <p>
                    In the future life to come, the continuous advancement of science and technology may lead to a
                    brand-new transformation
                    of network devices. The network will no longer be presented as a screen before people's eyes, but
                    will be hidden in the
                    minute details of life, such as the chips of household appliances, the fabrics of clothing, and the
                    surfaces of
                    high-rise buildings. It will be everywhere and closely collecting people's subtle changes to make
                    the most immediate
                    adjustments. Capture through people's expressions of joy, sadness, or the rhythm of their breathing
                    and the volume of
                    their voices.</p>
                To a certain extent, this will make the originally cold and inaccessible technology warmer and more
                reliable.
                </p>When I was tired and wanted to rest, the home appliances had already adjusted the water temperature
                for bathing and the
                indoor temperature.
                When I'm not happy, I will switch to soft lights and play music to relieve my mood.
                When I have multiple tasks, a reasonable itinerary will be planned for me in a timely manner.
                </p>People's complex emotions are quantified by "considerate" online data, and the behaviors resulting
                from different
                emotions are explained by the system. People have begun to become experimental subjects that can be
                effectively analyzed
                by technology, and emotions have become different research results that are constantly tested to improve
                technology. Due
                to the continuous improvement of technology, communication among people will become less and less, and
                emotions will be
                quantified into specific data such as percentages and line graphs. All the waves that surged like the
                sea froze into ice
                in an instant and never thawed again. The changes of the four seasons were reduced to a winter of snow
                that lasted for
                thousands of years in an instant. Those contradictory, flowing and complex emotions were reduced to the
                changes of data.
                </p>

                <h3>Daily life</h3>
                <p>
                    Communication in daily life may cause emotional disconnection due to the Internet. Family life or
                    living alone is
                    tenderly wrapped by network technology, and every emotional change is well known. Family members
                    don't need to care
                    about your experiences or emotional feelings. Friends will also seldom communicate and share with
                    each other, because
                    people's emotional panels have already summed up everything. The more mature the network technology
                    becomes, the
                    narrower the space for people to build emotions and connections becomes. In the workplace and
                    learning environment,
                    everyone's emotions are transparent and open. People may lose their hidden space, become hard to
                    breathe and survive.
                    Even when alone, people no longer trust their own feelings but first analyze their own changes based
                    on data records.</p>

                </p>

                <h3>Emotional space</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm not trying to stop or oppose the development of technology or the expansion of the online
                    environment. What I mean
                    is that during this process, people should not forget that they actually have the ability to handle
                    information and
                    emotions. People need emotional connections, to share happiness and also to communicate troubles.
                    Emotional space always
                    needs to be reserved by people, allowing them to have the opportunity to think quietly and possess
                    the courage and
                    ability to face others and themselves.</p>
