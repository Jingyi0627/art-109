            <h2>MEOW</h2>
            <p>The cat's furry body resembles a warm ball of yarn.</p>
            <p>Its large eyes gleam like glass marbles./p>
            <p>When it moves softly, its footsteps are utterly silent.</p>
            <p>The cat loves curling up in the sunlight, purring like a tiny engine.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, it playfully swats with its paws, as if playing hide-and-seek with the world.</p>

        <section id="dog">
            <h2>WOOF</h2>
            <p>The dog scampered over, tail wagging, like a cheerful little breeze.</p>
            <p>LIts round eyes sparkled with curiosity and innocence.</p>
            <p>When it bounded about, its fluffy body moved with lightness and agility.</p>
            <p>The dog loved to nudge you with their wet nose, offering friendly greetings.</p>
            <p>It rolled in the sunshine, its joyful yaps ringing out like tiny bells.</p>

        <section id="owl">
            <h2>HOO HOO</h2>
            <p>The owl glides silently through the night sky, its wings as quiet as the wind.</p>
            <p>Its large eyes sparkle with the light of wisdom.</p>
            <p>Owls love to perch on tall tree branches, observing everything around them.</p>
            <p>Occasionally, it emits a soft “hoo-hoo” call, as if telling stories in the night.</p>
            <p>The owl's feathers are soft and thick, keeping it warm and cozy through the cold nights.</p>
